# Pranav Hariharane's First CS193 Homework

- The students that are teaching me are really cool 
- The class can be used to bump my GPA
- The class teaches how to use the terminal. So instead of just watching my dad use it when he works and staring at his screen in awe, I can actually learn how to do what he does.
- The chairs are also kind of nice in my opinion

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

1. You use numbers followed by
2. a period and then a space
3. to start a numbered list

**You cover your letters with two stars on both sides to bold them.** 
_You cover your letters with underscores on both sides to italicize them._
`You cover your letters with rightwards pointing apostrophes on both sides to make them look like code.`



### Markdown

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme that you have selected by default in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file. I, on the other hand, have changed the theme to something more elegant.
